## Introduction

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that's widely used in robotics. Its simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. In this repository, we explore how Python can be used to handle various tasks in robotics, including data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Basic Python Syntax

Here we cover the fundamental syntax of Python, which is necessary for understanding the code examples and tutorials in this repository.

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## Libraries

### NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

- Array Creation and Manipulation
- Linear Algebra Operations
- Statistical Functions

### PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library. It's widely used in robotics for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

- Tensor Computation (like NumPy) with GPU Acceleration
- Automatic Differentiation for Building and Training Neural Networks

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. It's used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

- Basic Plotting
- Histograms, Bar Charts, Scatterplots
- Customization of Plots

### SciPy

SciPy is used for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides a large number of higher-level functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.

- Optimization and Fit
- Signal Processing
- Linear Algebra
